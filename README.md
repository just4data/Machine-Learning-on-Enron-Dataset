# Overview:

The Enron Email Corpus is one of the biggest email data sources in the world. In 2000, [Enron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus) was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corruption. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released more 1.6 million emails sent and received by 158 employees in the years from 2000-2002. Normally, emails are very sensitive, and rarely released to the public, but because of the shocking nature of Enronâ€™s collapse and after numerous complaints regarding the sensitive nature of the emails, the FERC redacted a large portion of the emails, but about +500k (over 1.5 GB) remain available to the public.

# About:

"Machine Learning on Enron Dataset.ipynb" applies a machine learning model to classify Enron emails dataset and turn them into insights by vectorizing the text using the tf-idf transformation then analysing & making sense of the result of a tf-idf.

poi_identifier.ipynb is python based code and part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree in which builds a predictive model that could potentially predict and spot culpable persons "person of interest (POI)", i.e. Enron employees who may have committed fraud, based on the aforementioned public data.

final_project_dataset.pkl is a pickle document that is created by Udacity coaches.
