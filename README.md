# Overview:

The Enron Email Corpus is one of the biggest email data sources in the world. In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corruption. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released more 1.6 million emails sent and received by Enron executives in the years from 2000-2002. Normally, emails are very sensitive, and rarely released to the public, but because of the shocking nature of Enronâ€™s collapse and after numerous complaints regarding the sensitive nature of the emails, the FERC redacted a large portion of the emails, but about +500k (over 1.5 GB) remain available to the public.
